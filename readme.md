An opinionated static build tool, powered by [webpack](http://webpack.github.io)

## Why should you care?

The thinking behind this experiment is explained in [this article](https://medium.com/@jescalan/eaa10c75eb22). Please feel free to comment and contribute.

### The Stack

Spike is fairly strict in enforcing a default stack. However, the stack allows for quite a large amount of flexibility as both the css and js parsers are able to accept plugins. The inflexibility with regards to the stack means faster compiles and more stability. We will be using...

- [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) for markup
- [babel](https://babeljs.io/) for JS and JS transforms
- [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for CSS transforms
- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) as the core compiler

## Installation

- `npm install spike -g`
- `spike new <projectname>`

## Usage

Spike can operate through either a javascript API or a CLI interface. This project is just the command line interface, for more information on the js api, check out [spike-core](https://github.com/static-dev/spike-core).

### Command Line Interface

Spike can be accessed through the command line if installed globally through npm (`npm i spike -g`). It exposes a binary by the name of `spike`.

#### Commands

- `spike new <projectname>`: creates a new spike project
- `spike watch [--env]`: watches your project, opens up a local server, recompiles and refreshes your browser when a file is changed and saved, powered by [browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
- `spike compile [--env]`: compiles a spike project once
- `spike clean`: removes your project's output directory

You can find spike's [standard starter template here](https://github.com/static-dev/spike-base), and it can be installed through [sprout](https://github.com/carrot/sprout).

### App.js

You can configure your spike projects through a single config file at the root, `app.js`. This file is fully processed by node, so you can do what you'd like with javascript. However, in order to work with spike, it must default export an object, which can have any of the following keys:

Option                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Default
:--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------
**root**               | **[required]** An absolute path to the root of your project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
**matchers**           | An object with `jade`, `css`, and `js` keys. Each key is a [micromatch](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/micromatch) string, and represents which files should be pulled into the pipeline to be processed. Be very careful if you are trying to change this.                                                        | `**/*.jade`, `**/*.css`, and `**/*.js`
**postcss**            | An object that can contain a `plugins` key, which is an array of [plugins to be passed to PostCSS](http://postcss.parts/) for CSS processing, and a `parser`, `stringifier`, and/or `syntax` key, each of which are objects and take [any of the postcss-loader options](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader#custom-syntaxes) |
**babelConfig**        | A [configuration object for Babel](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/) for JS processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**cleanUrls**          | Remove `.html` from your paths during `spike.watch`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `true`

> **Note:** Not familiar with minimatch or micromatch? Check out the [minimatch cheat sheet](https://github.com/motemen/minimatch-cheat-sheet) and test your patterns with [globtester](http://www.globtester.com). Trust us, it's a much cleaner and easier way to write regexes for the file system : )

## Environments

If you have different environments you intend to deploy to that need different settings, this is **[no probalo](http://www.hrwiki.org/w/images/8/85/Senor_Cardgage_shirt_close.PNG)**. Just make a second `app.js` file, but stick the name of your environment between the `app` and the `js`, like this: `app.production.js`. Now, when you initialize spike with the `production` environment, it will merge your production config (with priority) into your normal app config.

So let's say you have an app config that looks like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  ignores: [...],
  locals: {
    apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1'
  }
}
```

If you wanted to update that API url to a real one for production, you could set up an `app.production.js` file that looks like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  locals: {
    apiUrl: 'http://real-website.com/api/v1'
  }
}
```

Since the two configuration files are _merged_, you don't lose all your other settings from the `app.js` file, it just merges in any new ones from `app.production.js`. Very amaze!

To change the environment, just pass `--env name` or `-e name` as an argument to the `compile` or `watch` commands.
